# react-go-typing-test
A Typing test app built in React and Go.

This is a project I'm building as I'm learning Go.

Some of the futures I plan on having:

- [ ] Being able to type and show progress
- [ ] Being able to load custom code
- [ ] Being able to select what language you would like to code in
- [ ] Save progress
- [ ] Show the leaderboard
- [ ] Type against other players in real time?
